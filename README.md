# Laser Convection Boundary Condition

This code was developed during my Summer Internship at <a href="https://materialsmodellinggroup.github.io/">Materials Modelling Group</a>, <a href="https://iisc.ac.in/">IISc Bangalore</a>.

## Introduction to boundary condition
Boundary condition for a laser source boundary based on the Gaussian distribution function with additional convective heat transfer, based on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/shor-ty/laserconvectionbc/src">laserConvectionBC by Tobias Holzmann</a>

## Compiling the library and using the boundary condition
Please refer to the <a href = "https://github.com/asthana001/laser_convection_BC/blob/main/Laser__Convection_Boundary_Condition_User_Guide.pdf">Laser Convection Boundary Condition User Guide</a> for code compatibility, steps to compile and run the boundary condition.

## Compatible OpenFOAM Versions
I recommend using <a href="https://www.cfdsupport.com/openfoam-in-box.html">OpenFOAM-in-Box</a> to run this code. The code works with <a href="https://www.cfdsupport.com/openfoam-in-box.html">OpenFOAM-in-Box-20.09</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gzK8ipaC-be_dvljckus6uFizazkO1eU/view?usp=sharing">OpenFOAM-in-Box-18.10</a>.
