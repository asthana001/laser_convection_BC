# Laser Convection Boundary Condition

Boundary condition for a laser source boundary based on the Gaussian distribution function with additional convective heat transfer.

Please refer to the <a href = "https://github.com/asthana001/laser_convection_BC/blob/main/Laser__Convection_Boundary_Condition_User_Guide.pdf"> **Laser Convection Boundary Condition User Guide**</a> for code compatibility, steps to intall OpenFOAM and run the boundary condition.

I recommend using <a href="https://www.cfdsupport.com/openfoam-in-box.html">OpenFOAM-in-Box</a> to run this code. The code works with <a href="https://www.cfdsupport.com/openfoam-in-box.html">OpenFOAM-in-Box-20.09</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gzK8ipaC-be_dvljckus6uFizazkO1eU/view?usp=sharing">OpenFOAM-in-Box-18.10</a>.
